---     [COMPLETED]

[new feature]
-- OVERLAY:

    -accepts children to render components [NOT NEEDED] 
---     [COMPLETED]

-- MODAL CONTENT
    -new modal contents for saving to list/rating/bookmarks etc
    -- for viewing more information on particual anime..
    --- should work with Modal and Overlay
    
    --- ModalData's view for new Releases needs to have a way to sync with the user's watching list so new releases can have their progress updates. ex:
        [New release out for : Oshi no Ko, progress 3: (c) --- 5: (a) / 12: (t)  
        -  Therefore user should be able to +/- progres: (c) upto a value of (a), never exceeding 0 - (a) 
        -  On modal close, changes should be saved to user's list.]
    -- Feature is working, however need to look more into useEffect cleanup function to call on component unmount rather than on state change. 
---     [COMPLETED]
